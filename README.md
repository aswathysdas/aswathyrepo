#### Workflows

The Apriori is the best-known algorithm to mine association 

rules. It uses a breadth-first search technique to count the support 

of item sets and uses a candidate generation function which 

exploits the downward closure property of support. The 

bottom-up strategy is followed for generating candidate key, and 

groups of candidates are tested against the data. Then it prunes the 
candidates which have an infrequent sub pattern. According to the 
downward closure property, the candidate set contains all 
frequent k-length category sets. After that, it scans again the 
transaction database to determine frequent category sets among 
the candidates.
